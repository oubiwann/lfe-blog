We're about 1/4 of the way to the minimum pledges required for the order. If you'd like to order one or ten, you may do so <a href="http://www.customink.com/signup/96rbuknu">here</a>. For more information on the process, read on ...

### The Process

Even though the
<a href="https://twitter.com/oubiwann/status/493803591748968451">tweet
announcing the new T-shirt</a> was back in July, you haven't lost your chance
to get the new shirt :-) A lot was going on during the summer and fall, and
let's face it, who's going to do anything during the winter? But, it's the
first day of spring, so we have no excuses any more: it's time to get this
puppy re-started!

We need 40 t-shirt order "pledges" to get the price offered by
<a href="http://www.customink.com/">Custom Ink</a> ($28). And by pledges, we
just mean that you need to sign up using
<a href="http://www.customink.com/signup/96rbuknu">this form</a> -- you don't
actually pay yet. Once we've confirmed that enough T-shirts are desired, we'll
start emailing everyone who has pledged, letting you know it's time to Pay the
Pal :-)

### The T-Shirt

<a href="{{ site.base_url }}/assets/images/posts/lfescars2-back.png"><img class="right medium" src="{{ site.base_url }}/assets/images/posts/lfescars2-back.png" /></a>
The front of the shirt has the LFE logo (high-octane Î»-amrita) over the left
breast (keeping LFE close to your heart). The back of the shirt has a watermark
of an LFE translation of the Erlang ring benchmark used on the
<a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/program.php?test=threadring&lang=hipe&id=1">Computer
Language Benchmarks Game</a> site. Emblazoned across the shoulders is the
classic "Erlang" script logo, and then a reference to the closing comments of
"Mike Williams" in Garrett's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRbY3TMUcgQ">Erlang The Movie II: The Sequel</a>.

So, sign up now, and let us know you want a limited-edition LFE T-shirt (there
are only about 20 of the first LFE T-shirts made ... they're so rare, they
don't even show up on Ebay!).
