<a href="/assets/images/posts/t-shirt2-unbox-1.jpg"><img class="right thumb" src="/assets/images/posts/t-shirt2-unbox-1.jpg" /></a>The LFE community's latest T-shirt bonanza is drawing to a close, the conclusion of which will result in the perfect summer-wear for the discerning hacker. This is a fun little post that shares a bit of the T-shirt's unboxing :-)

As posted <a href="/formalwear/2015/03/20/1256-new-lfe-t-shirt/">here</a>,
we had been working on getting community members signed up for the next T-shirt
(this is actually the first full LFE T-shirt; the T-shirt we did last year was
for lfetool). This one was much trickier, as there were more colors to be
screen printed. I ended up working with CustomInk on several iterations in order
to get the color count down while still having a good looking logo.

my excitement of the shipment arriving, I'd forgotten to
document the whole process and cut open the box before remembering to take
pictures :-) We had 67 T-shirts ordered in this batch; it was quite amazing to
see so much LFE in physical, manifested reality! A box full of soft,
silky-smooth American Apparel LFEness ... mmmm.

before checking the manifest and ensuring that the counts were correct, I went
looking for my two shirts! These were quickly found and even more quickly
donned. Not too far behind came the unboxing selfies (I had to get some help
for the back-shot, though ...) As you can see, the darker red of the lambda got
lost in the brown of the T-shirt. Perhaps this grants the wearer of this
T-shirt entry into the Society of the Secret Lambda ...

firmly in place, I proceeded to sort by size, check the spreadsheet, and label
each person's order. I also managed to get the international orders packed up
with their customs forms filled out and ready to go. After this last picture
was taken, the domestic shipments also went out. A few days ago we started
getting tweets from folks whose T-shirts are already arriving!

This batch was a lot of work, so I hope folks enjoy their LFE T-shirts for
while before working up an appetite for another ... :-)
